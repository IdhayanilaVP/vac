                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h6>I am Idhayanila VP, a passionate and multi-talented student currently pursuing my third year under the stream of Computer Science and Engineering at Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology, Virudhunagar. 
                   With a deep interest in technology, communication, and leadership, I actively participate in technical symposiums, workshops, and competitions, often taking on the role of a coordinator or team leader.
                   As an NSS volunteer, I find purpose in organizing and hosting events, showcasing my dedication to community service and strong communication skills. My achievements include winning accolades in elocution, winning prizes in technical symposiums , and contributing significantly to department-level symposiums — earning me the “Best Contributor Award.”
                   Sports is another vital part of my identity. As an all-rounder and a district-level badminton player, I’ve won titles in both singles and doubles categories. I enjoy balancing academics with extracurricular excellence, and I take pride in being both a determined learner and a supportive teammate.
                   My current interests include languages like Java, Pyhton, database management, and Red Hat system administration. I am enthusiastic about exploring new technologies, leading initiatives, and growing into a tech-savvy, people-centric professional.
